# Release

If you want to get started with Newpay Docs as quickly as possible,
the Newpay Docs Cloud is the way to go. With the Newpay Docs Cloud,
you don't need to worry about provisioning a server or setting up any infrastructure.

If you prefer to self-host Newpay Docs, you can follow the documentation
to set up the Community Edition on your own server.
