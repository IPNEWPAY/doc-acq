### What is ShellHub?
ShellHub is a modern SSH server for remotely accessing Linux devices via the command line (using any SSH client) or web-based user interface. 

### How to start on ShellHub?
Nowadays there are two ways to get started on ShellHub very quickly: using cloud or community.
So, first of all, you may choose the option (the installation process is different).


**Is ShellHub free?**
The Open Source version is totally free and will always be kept that way. We welcome any kind of contribution to our project, so please feel welcome. But ShellHub also offers enterprise versions focused on cooperative features, for different business models: SaaS, Managed, or On-premises.  

**What is the difference between the ShellHub options: Open Source, Cloud, and Enterprise?**
The main difference lays in installing and features.
ShellHub agent in both versions is the same and the difference is in features implemented on the ShellHub Cloud, which in addition to the ShellHub Open Source server features includes some extra and exclusive features as well as technical support.
