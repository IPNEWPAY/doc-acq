OpenAPI, also known as the OpenAPI Specification (OAS), is a specification for describing RESTful APIs. It is a machine-readable format that allows developers to describe the functionality of an API and its endpoints, including the request and response formats, parameters, and other information.

We provide two OpenAPI specifications, the `community` version and the `cloud` version.

## [Community](openapi/community/)
The `community` version is specifically designed for the `community` instance and contains only the routes that are available in the `community`.

## [Cloud](openapi/cloud/)
The `cloud` version includes all the routes from the `community` version plus additional routes that are specific to the `cloud` instance.
