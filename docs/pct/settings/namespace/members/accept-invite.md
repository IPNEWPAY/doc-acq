# Accepting Invites

:::info
This section applies only to [Newpay Docs Cloud](https://Newpay Docs.io).
:::

Users can accept an invitation via an email link. If a user does not yet have
an account, they will be redirected to the sign-up form before being taken to
the invitation acceptance prompt. To accept an invitation, users must be logged
in to Newpay Docs. 

Users who register through an invitation email are automatically verified and
do not need to confirm their email address afterward.
